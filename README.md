## Game's Objective

The primary goal of the game is to put the opponent's king into a position known as "checkmate" where the king is in a position to be captured (in "check") and there is no move the opponent can make to move the king out of check. The game can also end in a draw under specific conditions, like stalemate.

## Rules of the Game

- The game starts with each player controlling an army of pieces, including one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns.
- Each type of piece moves differently:
  - **Pawns** move forward but capture diagonally.
  - **Rooks** move horizontally or vertically any number of squares.
  - **Knights** move in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular to that (or vice versa).
  - **Bishops** move diagonally any number of squares.
  - **Queens** combine the power of a rook and bishop and can move any number of squares in a straight line: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
  - **Kings** move one square in any direction.
- A player can't make a move that would put or leave their own king in check.
- Special moves include:
  - **Castling:** A move involving the king and either of the original rooks (not moved in the game) in which the king is moved two squares towards a rook on its initial square, then that rook is moved to the square the king skipped.
  - **Pawn Promotion:** When a pawn advances all the way to its eighth rank, it is then promoted and must be exchanged for the player's choice of queen, rook, bishop, or knight.
  - **First Pawn Movement:** A pawn can move 2 tiles on its first time moving.
  - **En passant:** A pawn capturing move that arises when a pawn makes a two-square move from its starting square and lands beside an opponent's pawn.

## Game Mechanics

- Players take turns moving one of their pieces.
- The goal is to use your pieces to attack your opponent's king, while also protecting your own king from attack.
- Each type of piece has its own way of moving on the 8x8 board.
- Players capture opponent's pieces by moving one of their pieces into a square occupied by an opponent's piece.
- The game continues until one player's king is checkmated, one player resigns, or the game ends in a draw (e.g., stalemate, threefold repetition, fifty-move rule without a pawn move or capture).
