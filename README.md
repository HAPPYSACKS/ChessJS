## Game's Objective

The primary goal of the game is to put the opponent's king into a position known as "checkmate" where the king is in a position to be captured (in "check") and there is no move the opponent can make to move the king out of check. The game can also end in a draw under specific conditions, like stalemate.

## Rules of the Game

- The game starts with each player controlling an army of pieces, including one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns.
- Each type of piece moves differently:

  - **Pawns** move forward 1 tile but capture diagonally. On their first turn, pawns have the ability to move 2 tiles.

  - **Rooks** move horizontally or vertically any number of squares.

  - **Knights** move in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular to that (or vice versa). Knights are the only piece in the game that can move through other units.

  - **Bishops** move diagonally any number of squares.

  - **Queens** combine the power of a rook and bishop and can move any number of squares in a straight line: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

  - **Kings** move one square in any direction.

- A player can't make a move that would put or leave their own king in check.
- Special moves include:
  - **Castling:** A move involving the king and either of the original rooks (not moved in the game) in which the king is moved two squares towards a rook on its initial square, then that rook is moved to the square the king skipped.
  - **Pawn Promotion:** When a pawn advances all the way to its eighth rank, it is then promoted and must be exchanged for the player's choice of queen, rook, bishop, or knight.
  - **First Pawn Movement:** A pawn can move 2 tiles on its first time moving.
  - **En passant:** A pawn capturing move that arises when a pawn makes a two-square move from its starting square and lands beside an opponent's pawn.

## Game Mechanics

- Players take turns moving one of their pieces.
- The goal is to use your pieces to attack your opponent's king, while also protecting your own king from attack.
- Each type of piece has its own way of moving on the 8x8 board.
- Players capture opponent's pieces by moving one of their pieces into a square occupied by an opponent's piece.
- The game continues until one player's king is checkmated, one player resigns, or the game ends in a draw (e.g., stalemate).

## Game States in Chess

### Check

"Check" is a situation where the current player's king is under direct threat of capture on the next opponent's move. When a player's king is in check, they must make a move to get out of check. This can be accomplished by:

1. Moving the king to a safe square.
2. Capturing the threatening piece.
3. Blocking the path of the threatening piece (if applicable, e.g., in case of a threat from a rook, bishop, or queen).

**Note**: A player cannot make a move that places or leaves their own king in check.

### Checkmate

"Checkmate" occurs when a player's king is in check and there is no legal move they can make to get the king out of check. In this situation, the game ends immediately, and the player whose king is checkmated loses. The objective of chess is to checkmate the opponent's king.

### Stalemate

A "stalemate" occurs when it is a player's turn to move, but they have no legal moves available, and their king is not in check. Unlike checkmate, where the player in check loses, a stalemate results in the game ending in a draw. This means that neither player wins or loses. Stalemates can occur in various board situations and are sometimes used as a defensive strategy when a player is at a disadvantage but can force a position where the opponent has no legal moves.
